### 2 - Large Language Model Operations
[LLMOps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llmops/?utm_campaign=googlecloud3-launch&utm_medium=announcement&utm_source=discourse) (DeepLearning.AI & Google Cloud)
  - Retrieve and transform training data for supervised fine-tuning of an LLM.
  - Version data and tuned models to track your tuning experiments.
  - Configure an open-source supervised tuning pipeline and then execute that pipeline to train and then deploy a tuned LLM.
  - Output and study safety scores to responsibly monitor and filter your LLM applicationâ€™s behavior.
  - Tun and deploy LLM. Practice with Tools as BigQuery data warehouse, the open-source Kubeflow Pipelines, and Google Cloud.

### 3 - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
[LangChain Chat with Your Data](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/) (DeepLearning.AI & LangChain)
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a common LLM application that retrieves contextual documents from an external dataset.
  - Building a chatbot that responds to queries based on the content of your documents, rather than the information it has learned in training.
