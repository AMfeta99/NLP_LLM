Have you ever wondered what life was like 20, 30, 40, or even 100 years ago? How did our parents communicate? What did their phones and cars look like? 
Isnâ€™t it amazing to see how much things have changed and evolved over time? And even more mind-blowing imagining what the future might look like!
