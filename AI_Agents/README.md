# AI Agents and Multi-Agents Topics
This repository explores various topics, tools, and techniques that are currently widely used in LLM (Large Language Model) projects or are gaining significant attention in the AI community. One key area of focus is AI Agents, which involve the integration of multiple LLMs to perform specific tasks collaboratively and enhance overall performance.

### [AI Agents in LangGraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/) (DeepLearning.AI, LangChain & Tavily)
 - Build an agent from scratch and understand the division of tasks between the LLM.
 - Implement the agent you built using LangGraph.
 - Implement agentic search for structured answers and enable state management for conversation continuity and persistence.
 - Incorporate Human-in-the-Loop in agents and develop a system to automate the essay-writing process, mimicking a researcher's workflow.

### [Multi_AI.Agent_Systems](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/69d70f04-ea1b-4eb3-b21a-ef3194434510?usp=sharing) (DeepLearning.AI, & CrewAI)
 - Design and Organize AI Agent: Create and manage a team of AI agents that collaborate to perform complex, multi-step tasks more effectively than a single LLM.
 - Key Principles of AI Agent Systems: Explore concepts like role assignment, memory management, tool integration, task focus, error handling, and agent cooperation.
 - Use the open-source library (CrewAI) to automate common business processes, including resume tailoring, customer support, event planning, and financial analysis.
 - Building multi-agent systems to streamline tasks and improve efficiency in real-world scenarios.

### [Multi_AI.Agents_Advanced_UC](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/481db1cf-eefd-4a97-ae70-1ecd6b9487d3?usp=sharing) (DeepLearning.AI, & CrewAI)
 - Practical Applications: Create systems for automated project planning, lead scoring, data reporting, customer support analysis, and large-scale content creation.
 - Optimization and Integration: Master techniques for performance testing, human feedback-based training, and connecting multi-agent systems with internal and external systems.
 - Real-World Insights: Gain industry perspective with a bonus interview on deploying agentic workflows and hands-on use cases involving LLMs and multi-agent collaboration.
