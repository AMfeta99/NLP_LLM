# Natural Language processing & Large Language Models| NLP & LLM
This repository is dedicated to projects and some theoretical material that I used to get into the areas of NLP and LLM in a practical/efficient way.


## Master Thesis
My NLP journey started in 2021-2022 during the development of my master's thesis entitled:
### ["Learning to write medical reports from EEG data"](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/144617) 
This aims the development of methods for clinical report writing based on EEG signals, adapting current NLP techniques and state-of-the-art captioning approaches to image, signal and video. 

Due Legal/privacy restrictions, code/implementation cannot be publicly available, however the dissertation has been published and can be accessed at [link](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/144617). 

The document includes an introdutions to NLP, state-of-the-art approach for captioning in image/signal/video, details development and comparison of 6 pipelines for EEG captioning.


## Courses
Since then, interest and popularity in the area has been growing, particularly due to the emergence of transformers and LLM applications. So, in an attempt to keep up with this development, I took some courses on more recent topics in the areas offered by some of the big players. This repository includes some theoretical/notes and pratical material of thoses.


### [Finetuning Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/programs/bosch-learning-program-8hold/projects/finetuning-large-language-models-project?source=search) (DeepLearning.AI & LAMINI)
With finetuning, you’re able to take your own data to train the model on it, and update the weights of the neural nets in the LLM, changing the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation. Finetuning allows the model to learn style, form, and can update the model with new knowledge to improve results.
