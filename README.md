# Natural Language processing & Large Language Models| NLP & LLM

NLP journey started in 2021-2022 during the development of my master's thesis entitled 
### ["Learning to write medical reports from EEG data"](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/144617) 
This aims the development of methods for clinical report writing based on EEG signals, adapting current NLP techniques and state-of-the-art captioning approaches to image, signal and video. 
Due Legal/privacy restrictions, code/implementation cannot be publicly available, however the dissertation has been published and can be accessed at [link](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/144617). 
The document includes an introdutions to NLP, state-of-the-art approach for captioning in image/signal/video, details development and comparison of 6 pipelines for EEG captioning.

"This repository is dedicated to small projects and some theoretical material that I used to self-teach/learn MLOps Learning in a practical way.

My journey in this field began by taking the specialization offered by DeepLearning.ai. This offering offers complete, in-depth details to guide you from the introductory level to the most advanced techniques. It covers how to conceptualize, build, and maintain integrated systems that continuously operate in production.


## [Finetuning Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/programs/bosch-learning-program-8hold/projects/finetuning-large-language-models-project?source=search) (DeepLearning.AI & LAMINI)
With finetuning, youâ€™re able to take your own data to train the model on it, and update the weights of the neural nets in the LLM, changing the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation. Finetuning allows the model to learn style, form, and can update the model with new knowledge to improve results.
